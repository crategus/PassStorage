<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
PassStorage is a simple program for storing passwords, keys, or any other credentials.
This program is inspired by similar one called Revelation.
Currently the only supported file format is format of Revelation.
</p>

<p>
Now PassStorage successfully tested on:
<ul>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux sid amd64</li>
<li>Ubuntu 9.10 i386</li>
<li>Windows XP 32 bit</li>
<li>Windows 7 64 bit</li>
</ul>
All binary distributions are made with SBCL compiler.
Also PassStorage can be compiled with Clozure CL version 1.4 or above.
</p>

<h2>'Yet another' password storage?</h2>

<p>
Yes and no. Originally this project was started as exercise to learn Common Lisp.
Absence of Revelation on Windows platform made this program usefull for
those who use both desktops Gnome and Windows.
Now it is mature enough to use it daily.
